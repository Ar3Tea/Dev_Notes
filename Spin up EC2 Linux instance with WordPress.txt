A few speedbumps that may come up --

When using additional ports to serve different pages, make sure security groups has rule added to allow this
Listening ports in 000-default.conf need to be added as well as new <VirtualHost> rules for the new port
Make sure ServerName IP/Domain is added to apache2.conf
double check in prots.conf to allow port listening for multiple pages on 1 instance
