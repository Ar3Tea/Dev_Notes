Some React Terms and Processes to Remember:

Components -- class MyComponent extends React.Component {}

This -- this.method will usually refer to the method defined

Props -- the object holding the information behind a component, when a component passes this information to another, it's called "giving props" lovingly

Import/Export -- using components from multiple files must be exported from the file and imported into the one being used:

import MyFunc from './MyFile'
export class MyFunc extends React.Component {}

Components can render other components - may sometimes need import/export depending on componenet location

ReactDOM.render(const, document.getElementById('app')
ReactDOM.render(<component />, document.getElementByID('app)

Const -- variable
Class -- component

class MyClass extends React.Component {
	render() {
	   const myConst = 

	return (
	  <div></div>
	);
     }
  }

Component first letter capital
Const cameCase
