Deface is a standalone Rails library that enables you to customize Erb templates
without needing to directily edit the underlying view file.

`Deface::Override.new(:virtual_path  => 'spree/something/edit',` this is the page where the override will go

`:name => 'my_name_functionality',` this tell Deface what to name the override

`:insert_bottom => ".inner",` This tells Deface WHERE to override

`:partial => '/spree/shared/my_partial_with_javascript_functions')` this tells Deface what to use as the override
