A few speedbumps that may come up --

Always make sure to restart or reload nginx -- sudo systemctl restart/reload nginx
Always check to make sure edits have been implemented properly -- sudo nginx -t
You may run into some issues when installing PHP, be sure to update -- sudo apt-get update -- and upgrade sudo apt-get upgrade -- and in rare cases -- sudo apt-get dist-upgrade. Once all is upgraded/updated the PHP packages should install as normal.
Certain additional PHP packages may not install due to dependencies. the one offender I found was php-mcrypt, but this is not necessary yet.
When you install plugins or need updates to WordPress be sure to install dependcies your system will say you need when installing/updating
