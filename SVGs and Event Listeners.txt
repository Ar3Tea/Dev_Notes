When working with SVGs on pages with even listeners always be sure to find out what program the SVG was created in
In certain situations the Event Listeners will be coded to the exact output of a specific program E.g. Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, etc.

<g> tags for grouping will separate into categories for the event listener to respond to
