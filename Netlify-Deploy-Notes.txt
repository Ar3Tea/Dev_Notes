When deploying to Netlify, builds need to be inspected before deployment.
If you miss something simple like syntax in your package.json your build will fail.

There are logs in Netlify to check but you will not always get enough information from them to act on.

Common build fails:

package.json has errors
file structure is not correct
development deploy had warnings or errors that you can ignore locally but will fail a build
